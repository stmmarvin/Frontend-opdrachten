        Cocaine Bear
        <ul>
          <li>
            With a title so short and to the point that it makes Snakes on a
            Plane seem convoluted, Cocaine Bear is "inspired by" the true story
            of a black bear that swallowed a drug dealer's stash of cocaine. The
            sad reality is that the bear died almost immediately afterwards. It
            was then stuffed and displayed in the Kentucky Fun Mall, and
            labelled "Pablo Escobear". But in this raucous horror comedy,
            directed by Elizabeth Banks (Pitch Perfect 2, Charlie's Angels), our
            ursine hero rampages through a forest, attacking campers and
            criminals played by Keri Russell, O'Shea Jackson Jr, Alden
            Ehrenreich and the late Ray Liotta. If the viral trailer is anything
            to go by, Cocaine Bear should be a blast, although it probably won't
            win many Oscars.

        65 The Jurassic Park
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Jurassic Park / World franchise might have gone extinct with
            Jurassic World Dominion, but there are plenty more dinosaurs on the
            big screen in 65. Adam Driver stars as Commander Mills, a spaceship
            pilot "on a long-range exploratory mission" who crash-lands on a
            wilderness planet. It looks as if only one of his passengers has
            survived, a girl played by Ariana Greenblatt. But they aren't alone.
            The twist is that they're actually on Earth, 65 million years ago
            (hence the title). Does that mean Mills has travelled back in time?
            Or is he an alien who happens to look human? The film's
            writer-directors, Scott Beck and Bryan Woods, are the co-writers of
            A Quiet Place, so they know a thing or two about lean, mean,
            survival thrillers involving showdowns between humans and hungry
            monsters.

        John Wick, Chapter 4
        <ul>
          <li>
            Keanu Reeves returns as the assassin-but-hero John Wick, now
            scowling, kicking and killing his way across continents. He travels
            through Paris, Berlin, Osaka and other James-Bond like locations as
            if Bond were a hit man instead of a spy. This time the entire
            criminal world, including the High Table leaders who control all the
            crime organisations, seems to be after Wick. Because he was
            disloyal? Because he likes dogs too much? The plots hardly matter in
            this hugely successful, relentlessly fast action franchise. Wick
            stalwarts Laurence Fishburne and Ian McShane are back, too.

        Renfield
        <ul>
          <li>
            In Bram Stoker's Dracula, Renfield is the undead Count's devoted
            servant, a madman who eats flies and plots his escape from an
            asylum. But he gets a makeover in this horror comedy from Chris
            McKay, director of The Lego Batman Movie. Nicholas Hoult (The Great,
            The Favourite) has the title role. He is still doing his master's
            bidding in present-day New Orleans, but, says McKay, Dracula is "the
            boss from Hell" in more ways than one, so Renfield prefers to spend
            time with a traffic cop played by Awkwafina. Hoult showed that he
            could handle monster-related romantic comedy in Warm Bodies, in
            which he was a lovestruck zombie, but the really intriguing casting
            is Nicolas Cage as a red-suited Count Dracula. File under "The Role
            he was Born to Play".

        The Little Mermaid
        <ul>
          <li>
            Disney's remake of the 1989 animated classic is live action – or as
            life-like as a story about a half-human, half-fish princess can be.
            Halle Bailey, who sings with her sister as the group Chloe x Halle,
            plays Ariel, longing to grow legs so she can join her prince on
            land. The starry cast includes Melissa McCarthy as Ursula the sea
            witch, Javier Bardem as Ariel's father, King Triton, and Daveed
            Diggs as Sebastian the crab (you can almost hear him singing Under
            the Sea already). Along with the original songs by Alan Menken and
            the late Howard Ashman, there are four new ones by Menken and
            Lin-Manuel Miranda. The director, Rob Marshall, is familiar with
            fairy tales, having directed the films Into the Woods and Mary
            Poppins Returns.

        Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse
        <ul>
          <li>
            In 2018, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse brought together numerous
            different animation styles to form a mesmerising pop-art
            masterpiece. It also brought together numerous different
            Spider-People. The wall-crawlers from various alternate realities
            included a new Spider-Man, Miles Morales (Shameik Moore), a familiar
            one, Peter Parker (Jake Johnson), and a Spider-Woman, Gwen Stacy
            (Hailee Steinfeld). But that was just the beginning. The sequel is
            due to span six parallel universes, and to feature 240 characters,
            many of them Spider-related: Oscar Isaac, for instance, provides the
            voice of the Spider-Man of the year 2099. The multiple realities in
            Everything Everywhere All at Once and Doctor Strange in the
            Multiverse of Madness may soon seem simple in comparison...

        Asteroid City
        <ul>
          <li>
            Wes Anderson's latest skewed take on the world is set in 1955 in a
            fictional US desert town where children and parents attend a Junior
            Stargazer/ Space Cadet convention. The official description says
            only that a cataclysmic event disrupts things, so I'll go out on a
            limb and guess that the asteroid in the title has something to do
            with it. What we know for sure is that Anderson's films – The Grand
            Budapest Hotel and The French Dispatch among his best – are
            illogical and weird in the most wonderfully imaginative ways, and
            that the cast is beyond spectacular, including Scarlett Johansson,
            Tom Hanks, Tilda Swinton, Jason Schwartzman, Steve Carell, Margot
            Robbie and Willem Dafoe.

        Elemental
        <ul>
          <li>
            Pixar's latest cartoon is set in Element City, a metropolis where
            everyone is made of one of the four classical elements: earth,
            water, air and fire. But what happens when a watery man (voiced by
            Mamoudou Athie) is attracted to a fiery woman (Leah Lewis)? Could
            things get steamy? The clever anthropomorphic concept is typical of
            the studio that made Inside Out, but the director of Elemental,
            Peter Sohn, says that his culture-clash romance is really about
            growing up as the son of Korean immigrants in a multicultural
            neighbourhood in the Bronx. That's encouraging news. As Luca and
            Turning Red demonstrated, Pixar is currently at its best when
            filmmakers are allowed to put their own heritage on the screen.

        Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny
        <ul>
          <li>
            It's been 15 years since Indiana Jones and The Kingdom of the
            Crystal Skull came out – but now the 80-year-old Harrison Ford has
            dusted off his brown fedora for a fifth archaeological adventure.
            John Rhys-Davies is back as Sallah, who was in the first and third
            film, and John Williams is furnishing what he says will be his final
            score before retirement. But there are plenty of tantalising
            changes. Set in 1969, this is the only Indiana Jones film not to be
            directed by Steven Spielberg or based on a story by George Lucas
            (although the two are executive producers). James Mangold, who made
            Walk the Line and the last two Wolverine films, has taken over as
            director and co-writer. And he has brought in Mads Mikkelsen as a
            Nazi villain, Antonio Banderas as a new ally, and Phoebe
            Waller-Bridge as Indy's god-daughter.

        Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part One
        <ul>
          <li>
            Having starred in the biggest film of 2022, Top Gun: Maverick, Tom
            Cruise moves straight onto what is bound to be one of the biggest
            films of 2023. It's certainly got one of the biggest titles. Delayed
            by two years because of the pandemic, the sequel we'll just call
            "Mission: Impossible 7" reunites Cruise with his usual co-stars,
            Ving Rhames, Simon Pegg and Rebecca Ferguson, and the series'
            regular writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie. The espionage plot
            is still top secret, but what matter are the action sequences, and
            the stunts performed by Cruise himself. The biggie this time is "far
            and away the most dangerous thing we've ever attempted", he
            promises: driving a motorbike along a narrow ramp and over a cliff,
            and then parachuting to safety. Goodness knows what he's got in
            store for Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning Part Two in 2024.

        Barbie

            All it took was a couple of photos: Margot Robbie and Ryan Gosling
            rollerblading in retro-80s bubble-gum pink costumes as Barbie and
            Ken. The internet went wild and Barbie was suddenly one of the
            year's most anticipated films. Greta Gerwig, whose Little Women
            (2019) was both faithful to the book and refreshed with a
            21st-Century sensibility, directs a film that promises to be both
            satirical – another photo shows Robbie in Barbie's little pink
            convertible – and meta, with Will Ferrell as an executive at the toy
            manufacturer Mattel. The trailer parodies 2001: A Space Odyssey,
            with classic, blonde pony-tailed Barbie towering over a throng of
            little girls as if she were that film's obelisk. It's fun so far.

        Oppenheimer
        <ul>
          <li>
            Tenet (2020) left many viewers scratching their heads, but
            Christopher Nolan's latest seems more firmly grounded. As he did in
            Dunkirk, Nolan revisits the past, this time with a more
            controversial story. Cillian Murphy plays J Robert Oppenheimer, the
            US physicist who became known as "the father of the atomic bomb" and
            wrestled with the morality of his work for the rest of his life.
            Because everything Nolan does is big, this biopic is shot in Imax
            and features dramatic on-screen explosions set in the desert of New
            Mexico, where the bomb was tested. Emily Blunt plays Oppenheimer's
            scientist wife, Kitty, with Florence Pugh as his former love, Matt
            Damon as the US Army General who led the Manhattan Project that
            developed the bomb, and Robert Downey Jr as Lewis Strauss, who
            orchestrated government hearings that questioned Oppenheimer's
            loyalty.

          <li>
            Fraught romances – Call Me by Your Name and the recent cannibal love
            story Bones and All – are one of Luca Guadagnino's specialties. Here
            it's a love triangle on a tennis court. Zendaya plays Tashi, a
            former professional player and now the wife and coach of a champion,
            Art (Mike Faist), who is in a serious slump. When she urges him to
            begin his comeback in a low-stakes, Challengers tournament, his
            opponent turns out to be Tashi's former lover and Art's childhood
            best friend, Patrick (Josh O'Connor). It sounds like
            kiss-marry-kill, but the actors put in months of training to look
            like tennis pros, so actual sport is probably involved as well.

        Next Goal Wins

          <li>
            In 2001, Australia beat American Samoa at football, with a scoreline
            of 31-0. The American Samoan team was derided as the world's worst
            footballers for years afterwards, but their fortunes changed when
            they hired Thomas Rongen, a determined Dutch-US coach. Their
            underdog story will be familiar to anyone who saw the 2014
            documentary of the same name, an uplifting, Cool Runnings-style film
            that scored 100% on Rotten Tomatoes. But now it is being retold as a
            feelgood comedy drama, directed by Taika Waititi (Thor: Ragnarok,
            Jojo Rabbit), and starring Michael Fassbender as Rongen. Football
            fans who were uneasy about last year's controversial World Cup in
            Qatar might find that Waititi restores their faith in the beautiful
            game.

          <li>
            You know what to expect from Denis Villeneuve's follow-up to his
            2021 extravaganza: Timothée Chalamet as Paul Atreides, Zendaya as
            his love interest, Chani, plus lots of sand and giant sandworms on
            the desert planet of Arrakis. The action-spectacle begins where Dune
            left off, with Atreides out for revenge against the enemies who
            attacked his family. Stellan Skarsgård returns as the evil Baron
            Harkonnen, with Austin Butler (Elvis) joining as his nephew.
            Whatever you thought of Dune – responses were split between
            impressed and disappointed – a new bit of casting could make the
            sequel hard to resist: Christopher Walken plays Emperor Shaddam IV
            and Florence Pugh is his daughter.
